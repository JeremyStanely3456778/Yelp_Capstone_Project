Solution 1
----------

1. Loaded JSON files into bucket on Google Cloud Storage.
2. On Google Console: Go to Big Query> Add Data > Google Cloud Storage > Create Table: Filled out 
required Fields (Chose Auto Detect Schema) > Create Table 
3. This in turn created a load job and transfered data from Google Cloud Storage to Tables in specified
dataset. No Transformations or coding needed for this approach.

Notes: This was by far the most simple approach. This approach would have worked for both small and
big files.

Solution 2
---------
Please see: yelp_json_to_csv_etl_job.ipynb within this repo. 

Note: This solution worked with small files
within dataset(size in megabytes), not the big files(size in Gigabytes).
